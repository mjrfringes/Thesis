\section{Practical implementation and test results}


\subsection{Testing setups and limitations}
\subsubsection{Talk about the way we test in the high bay, etc}
\subsubsection{List of test setups: gyro only, gyro+star camera, gyro+star camera+tip/tilts with CCD cameras, gyro+star camera with H1RG;}
\subsubsection{Explain the communication/data recording approach}
\subsection{Implementation}

\input{Figures/KalmanFilter}

\subsubsection{Star camera software}
This software was not written by us, so maybe not include this part in detail?
\subsubsection{Autofocus algorithm and performance}
\subsubsection{	Gondola attitude estimator}
\subsubsection{Telescope attitude estimator}
\subsubsection{Phase estimator [is that Arnabâ€™s realm?]}
\subsubsection{Track mode}
\subsubsection{	Slew mode}
\subsubsection{	Acquire mode [this one is contingent on the telescopes working, and is not perfectly representative when only using one single side of the payload]}
\subsection{	Pointing tests and performance results}
\subsubsection{Gyro only}
Spectral analysis when attached on the gondola
Noise caracteristics
\subsubsection{	Gyros+star camera}
\subsubsection{	gyro+star camera+tip/tilts with CCD cameras}
\subsubsection{	gyro+star camera with H1RG;}
\subsection{	Using the test results to estimate the flight performance (have to think more about that section)}
\subsubsection{	Perturbation rejection estimates}
\subsubsection{	Pointing knowledge predictions}
\subsubsection{	Pointing control predictions}
