\section{3D attitude estimation and sensor fusion}
\label{sec:KalmanFilter}
\renewcommand*{\arraystretch}{0.75}


The attitude estimation consists of combining high-frequency angular velocity measurements of the payload with low-frequency attitude measurements. The high-frequency measurements, usually from gyroscopes, are relative measurements, and exhibit biases. The attitude measurements are absolute. The Kalman filter \citep{Kalman:1960ii} combines these two types of measurements in a mathematical formalism that uses a model of the physical relationship between them. For the simplest version of this filter, the goal is to estimate the bias of the high-frequency measurements, hence providing bias-corrected, drift-less, trustworthy dynamical information that can be used to estimate the attitude at all times, even when there is no absolute measurement. In the general sense, the filter finds the state parameters that minimize the covariance of the error between a predicted quantity (in our case, the predicted attitude from integrated gyroscope velocities), and a measured quantity (in our case, an absolute attitude measurement from the star cameras). 

%In our situation, gyroscopes will provide high-frequency velocity data (typically at 100~Hz), while star cameras will provide absolute measurements every few seconds. The gyroscopes are much more trustworthy over short periods, so they won't be influenced by just a few star camera measurements. However, on long timescales, the attitude as propagated using the gyroscopes will drift with respect of the star cameras because of the gyroscopes' inherent biases. The Kalman filter will estimate those biases and provide a bias-corrected angular velocity to make sure that the gyroscopes do not drift away from the star camera results.

This filter is very common for spacecraft attitude and control, although a large number of variations exist. It was first popularized in the 60's in the United States during the Apollo missions, when it was used to determine the attitude of the Apollo capsules in inertial space. It also continues to be an active field of research today \citep[e.g.,][]{Crassidis:2011ud,Markley:2014dn}. Under certain circumstances and assumptions, the Kalman filter is the optimal filter, which means that it is the filter that has the fastest possible convergence towards the minimum steady-state error covariance.


One of the complexities of the Kalman filter is that it involves inverting matrices to find the optimal solution when new absolute measurements are received. This has implications in terms of numerical complexity which often will limit the bandwidth of the filter, especially in the context of resource-limited FPGA computers on spacecraft. In practice the trade-off is the following: either limit the bandwidth of the filter, or limit the number of state parameters (\textit{i.e.} limit the rank of the matrix to invert). On the ground, this limitation is usually not an issue. But even our powerful embedded computer will be limited in the speed at which it can find solutions.

In order to set up the Kalman filter, we choose quaternions to describe our attitude, which are discussed extensively and compared to other attitude representations in Appendix~\ref{sec:attituderepresentation}. In addition to the various advantages explained in this appendix, quaternions have a nice behavior when it comes to small angles, so we can use them in their linear, small angle approximation to create a \textit{multiplicative}, \textit{extended} Kalman filter (MEKF) \citep{Lefferts:1982dx}. It is \textit{extended} because it operates in the small angle approximation, hence it is a local approximation of a non-linear relationship. And it is \textit{multiplicative}, instead of being additive, because we use the quaternion multiplication operation to describe the "difference" or error between measured and predicted attitudes. One popular instance where this filter was successfully implemented on board the WMAP spacecraft \citep{Harman:2005ux}.

First, we need to choose a representation for our sensor suite: the gyroscopes and the star cameras. Second, we describe the equations that govern the physics of our system and connect the sensors together: this is critical for the Kalman filter to produce robust estimates, and the more accurate our representation is, the more accurate our predictions can be. Third, we discuss the Kalman setup, and two phases of the algorithm: prediction and update. And finally, we discuss potential improvements of the filter that can be used for ground-based analysis of the data.

\subsection{Sensor models}
\label{sec:SensorModels}

This section describes the chosen mathematical model that will be used to represent our sensors. These are necessarily approximations, as they do not encompass all of the possible physical effects that will be observed. The residual, non-modeled physical effects need to be small with respect to this representation in order for this filter to work optimally. In the ideal case, when all physical contributors are accounted for, and when the residual noises have a normal distribution, the Kalman filter is the optimal filter. 

\subsubsection{Gyroscope model}

For our baseline design, the gyroscope model that we use is: $\gyroVecMeas  =  \gyroVec + \bias + \nGyros$, where $\gyroVecMeas$ is the measured angular velocity vector, $\gyroVec$ is the true angular velocity vector, $\bias$ is the bias vector, and $\nGyros$ is the angular velocity noise vector (also called the "rate noise"). This implies that we have ideal alignment between each gyroscope and what we define to be the gyroscope reference frame. We consider that $\nGyros$ is a white noise process with a diagonal covariance matrix $\N_\gyro = \sigma_{c,\gyro}^2\bI_{3\times 3}$. 

We consider that the derivative of the bias $\bias$ is also a white noise process: $\dot{\bias} = \nBias$, where $\nBias$ has a diagonal covariance matrix $\N_\bias = \sigma_{c,b}^2\bI_{3\times 3}$.

Assuming that the covariance matrices are diagonal help to set up the filter, but is not a necessary assumption in the general case. The following implementation is not relying on this assumption.

%The angular random walk of the gyroscope assemblies is 0.2~deg.sec$^{-1}$ with an effective bandwidth of 50~Hz (100~Hz sampling). 
The angular random walk (ARW) that we measure is ARW~$\approx\SI{5e-4}{\deg\per\hour}$. This means that if we integrate the gyroscope's rate for 1~hour, the $1\sigma$ uncertainty on our position would be 
$\SI{5e-4}{\deg}\sim\ang{;;1.8}$. For an integration time of 1 second, it would be \ang{;;0.03}. For a single integration time step $\Deltat = \SI{0.01}{\second}$, it would be \ang{;;0.003}. 

The units required for $\sigma_\gyro$ are [\si{\radian\raiseto{-0.5}\second}], so we convert:
\begin{equations}
\sigma_\gyro\units{\si{\radian\raiseto{-0.5}\second}} = \frac{\pi}{60\times180}\times \textrm{ARW}\units{\si{\deg\raiseto{-0.5}\hour}} \sim 1.5\times 10^{-7}~\si{\radian\raiseto{-0.5}\second}.
\end{equations}

Note that we can relate the ARW to the measured discrete rate noise uncertainty $\sigma(\nGyros^\textrm{meas})$ with:
\begin{equations}
\sigma(\nGyros^\textrm{meas})\units{\si{\deg\per\second}} = \textrm{ARW}\units{\si{\deg\raiseto{-0.5}\hour}}\times 60\sqrt{\textrm{BW}\units{\si{\hertz}}},
\end{equations}
where $\textrm{BW}\units{\si{\hertz}}$ is the gyroscope's bandwidth, equal to \SI{50}{\hertz} for our system. We obtain a quantity close to the measured quantity, $\sigma(\nGyros^\textrm{meas})\sim\SI{0.2}{\arcsec\per\second}$.

The bias instability units are [\si{\radian\raiseto{-3/2}\second}]. We adopt the manufacturer's specification for a worst-case scenario bias instability over a wide range of temperatures equal to \SI{0.005}{\deg\per\hour}. This is for a bandwidth of \SI{50}{\hertz}, so we obtain the bias instability term, which also corresponds to the process noise of our Kalman filter:
\begin{equations}
\sigma_\bias\units{\si{\radian\raiseto{-3/2}\second}} = \SI{0.005}{\deg\per\hour}\times \sqrt{\textrm{BW}\units{\si{\hertz}}}  \sim \SI{1.8e-7}{\radian\raiseto{-3/2}\second}.
\end{equations}
This represents how much what we are trying to estimate is expected to vary. While this drift appears to be very slow, it increases linearly with time (as opposed to the ARW which increases as the square root of the time). Hence, the bias drift quickly increases the position uncertainty when integrating the gyroscopes, which justifies the efforts in trying to properly estimate its properties and correct for it as often as possible.

\subsubsection{Star camera model}

The star camera takes a picture of the sky to make noisy measurements of the right ascension (RA) and declination (DEC) of the boresight, as well as the roll angle (ROLL) in which the frame is taken. The RA and DEC typically are much more accurate than the roll angle. Each angle can be used as en Euler angle to define the attitude of the payload in the inertial frame (or equivalently, the rotation from the inertial frame to the current attitude). Each angle corresponds to a quaternion rotation about a single axis: 
\begin{eqnarrays}
\quat{q}_\textrm{RA} &=& [0, 0, \sin(\textrm{RA}/2),\cos(\textrm{RA}/2)]^T,\\
\quat{q}_\textrm{DEC} &=& [ 0, \sin(\textrm{DEC}/2), 0,\cos(\textrm{DEC}/2)]^T,\\
\quat{q}_\textrm{ROLL}& = &[  \sin(\textrm{ROLL}/2),0,0,\cos(\textrm{ROLL}/2)]^T,\\
\Attitude^{\textrm{meas}}_{\starcam}& = &\quat{q}_\textrm{ROLL}\quat{q}_\textrm{DEC}\quat{q}_\textrm{RA}.
\end{eqnarrays}

The errors associated with the three Euler angles are assumed to be a random vector $\nStarcam$, also with a diagonal covariance matrix $\measCovMat$. Typical star camera noises are 1-\ang{;;2} in RA and DEC and \ang{;;100} r.m.s. in ROLL (see Chapter~\ref{chap:implementation}). 

The star camera is oriented at a fixed position on the payload, which is not necessarily aligned with the gyroscope reference frame. In that case, the attitude quaternion needs to be rotated by the quaternion representing the transformation between both reference frames. In addition, the covariance matrix needs to be rotated by the direction cosine matrix corresponding to the same transformation. This would not have an effect if the covariance matrix was a multiple of the identity matrix, but it usually is not the case since the Roll measurement is often much less sensitive. This can have implications while designing the balloon payload and deciding on the placement and orientation of the star camera: the attitude estimation will be less precise about the Roll axis of the star camera.

%The fundamental problem is trying to determine the attitude of the payload in the inertial reference frame, using biased gyroscope measurements at high frequency and absolute star camera measurements at low frequency.

\subsection{Continuous state equation and error}

We want to use the Kalman filter to obtain an estimate of the attitude quaternion $\Attitude_k \equiv \fromto{I}{G}\Attitude(t)$, but also use it to estimate the gyroscope biases $\bias(t)$ to improve our attitude predictions and lower the errors between predicted and measured. The "state" of our system is described by the vector:
\begin{equations}
\stateVec(t) = \begin{bmatrix} \fromto{I}{G}\Attitude(t) \\ \bias(t) \end{bmatrix}.
\end{equations}

The evolution of the state is governed by the two differential equations that follow:
\begin{eqnarrays}
\fromto{I}{G}\dotAttitude(t) & = &\frac{1}{2}\matOmega(\gyroVec(t))\fromto{I}{G}\Attitude(t),\\
\dot{\bias}(t) & = & \nBias(t),
\end{eqnarrays}
with $\gyroVec = \gyroVecMeas - \bias - \nGyros$. These equations represent the exact relationship between our quantities of interest, assuming that the noise values are known. In practice, we will create an \textit{estimator} that is used to evaluate the expected value of these quantities. This estimator, $\EstStateVec = \left[\EstAttitude(t) , \EstBias(t)\right]^T$, is governed by the following equations:
\begin{eqnarrays}
\fromto{I}{G}\dotEstAttitude(t) & = &\frac{1}{2}\matOmega(\EstGyroVec(t))\fromto{I}{G}\EstAttitude(t),\\
\dot{\EstBias}(t) & = & \boldsymbol{0},
\end{eqnarrays}



%\subsection{Error state representation}
%The state $\stateVec$ has 7 components, but it is numerically more stable to reduce it to 6 by using the unity constraint within the attitude quaternion. It is also possible to linearize the system using the error representation of the state. In this representation, our model is the difference between the true and estimated state. Since we use a quaternion representation for the attitude, it is convenient to express this difference in a multiplicative form:

The Kalman filter's goal is to minimize the variance of the estimator's error - that is, the covariance of the error vector $\stateVec-\EstStateVec$. However, in our case, we have constraints in the system since we force the quaternion to be of unit length: this introduces a singularity in the covariance matrix  of the error vector, and is prone to numerical complications. It is possible to circumvent this problem by using the multiplicative properties of the quaternion used in the small angle approximation. This is called a "multiplicative" Kalman filter, as opposed to a more traditional "additive" filter.

To do this, instead of following the evolution of the state $\EstStateVec$ itself, we will follow the evolution of the error vector $\ErrorState = [\deltaTheta,\deltaBias]^T$, where $\deltaTheta$ corresponds to the 3-dimensional angular error between true and estimated attitude quaternion taken from the difference quaternion $\fromto{\hat{G}}{G}\delta\Attitude = \fromto{I}{G}\Attitude\otimes\fromto{I}{\hat{G}}\EstAttitude^{-1} \approx [1,\frac{1}{2}\deltaTheta]^T$, and $\deltaBias = \bias - \EstBias$. 

The evolution of $\ErrorState$ as a function of time can be obtained by taking the quaternion derivative of the true attitude quaternion $\dotAttitude = \dot{\delta\Attitude} \otimes \EstAttitude + \delta\Attitude \otimes \dotEstAttitude$. With our gyroscope model, we can write:
\begin{eqnarrays}
\gyroVecMeas & = & \gyroVec + \bias + \nGyros,\\
 \EstGyroVec & = & \gyroVecMeas - \EstBias, \\
\textrm{so} \quad \gyroVec^\textrm{true} & = & \EstGyroVec - \nGyros - \deltaBias.
\end{eqnarrays}


% Traditionally, the Kalman filter uses a state, $\stateVec$, and tries to minim
% In order to define the Kalman filter, we need to understand the errorThe state $\stateVec$ has 7 components
% \begin{equations}
% \fromto{I}{G}\Attitude = \fromto{\hat{G}}{G}\delta\Attitude \otimes\fromto{I}{\hat{G}}\EstAttitude.
% \end{equations}
% For small angle approximations, we can write $\fromto{\hat{G}}{G}\delta\Attitude \approx [1,\frac{1}{2}\deltaTheta]^T$. $\deltaTheta_k$ represents the vector of angles that represent the rotation between the estimated and true reference frame in the angle-axis representation, and is expressed in the gyroscope reference frame.
% Similarly, we define $\deltaBias = \bias - \EstBias$, and form the 6-dimension error state representation $\ErrorState = [\deltaTheta,\deltaBias]^T$. It is now important to establish which equations govern this error state in order to understand the expected evolution of the system.

After a lengthy derivation to express $\dot{\deltaTheta}$ from $\dot{\delta\Attitude} = [0, \frac{1}{2}\dot{\deltaTheta}]^T$ \citep{Trawny:2005va}, we obtain:
\begin{equations}
\dot{\deltaTheta} = -\EstGyroVec\times\deltaTheta - \deltaBias - \nGyros.
\end{equations}
Note that the cross-product $\EstGyroVec\times\deltaTheta$ is equal to the matrix multiplication $\omegaCross\deltaTheta$, where $\omegaCross$ is the skew-symmetric matrix made out of the elements of $\EstGyroVec$.

The bias equation is: 
\begin{equations}
\dot{\deltaBias} = \dot{\bias} - \dot{\EstBias} = \nBias.
\end{equations}
We can now write the linearized equations representing the evolution of the error state $\ErrorState$:
\begin{equations}
\dot{\ErrorState} = \begin{bmatrix} \dot{\deltaTheta} \\ \dot{\deltaBias} \end{bmatrix} = \Fc \begin{bmatrix} \deltaTheta \\ \deltaBias\end{bmatrix} + \Gc \begin{bmatrix} \nGyros \\ \nBias \end{bmatrix},
\end{equations}
with
\begin{equations}
\Fc = \begin{bmatrix} \omegaCross & -\bI_{3\times 3} \\ \bzero_{3\times 3} & \bzero_{3\times 3} \end{bmatrix},
\end{equations}
and:
\begin{equations}
\Gc = \begin{bmatrix} -\bI_{3\times 3} & \bzero_{3\times 3} \\ \bzero_{3\times 3} & \bI_{3\times 3} \end{bmatrix}.
\end{equations}

It is important here to introduce the expression of the propagation error covariance matrix of this continuous representation. Writing the noise vector $\vectors{n} = \begin{bmatrix} \nGyros \\ \nBias \end{bmatrix}$, the covariance matrix is the expected value of the product of two noise vectors taken at different times \citep{Trawny:2005va}, but since we suppose that the noise samples are independent, the covariance is not a function of this time difference $\tau$:
\begin{equations}
\noiseCovMat_c = E[\vectors{n}(t+\tau)\vectors{n}^T(t)] = 
\begin{bmatrix} \sigma_{c,\gyro}^2\bI_{3\times 3} & \bzero_{3\times 3}\\ \bzero_{3\times 3} & \sigma_{c,b}^2\bI_{3\times 3}\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equations}

\subsection{Integration of continuous equations}

Since our system has a fast sampling rate compared to the characteristic times of the system, we can consider that $\Fc$ is constant over a time step in order to express the state evolution in a discrete sense, which is appropriate for a computer implementation. We can integrate the state equation between $t_{k-1}$ and $t_k=t_{k-1}+\Deltat$, which leads to a discrete state transition matrix $\StateTransitionMat_k$:
\begin{equations}
\StateTransitionMat_k = \StateTransitionMat(t_k, t_{k-1}) = \exp\left(\Fc\Delta t\right) \equiv \begin{bmatrix} \boldsymbol{\Theta_k} & \boldsymbol{\Psi_k} \\ \bzero_{3\times 3} & \bI_{3\times 3}\end{bmatrix},
\end{equations}
with $\boldsymbol{\Theta_k} \sim \bI_{3\times 3} - \Deltat\omegaCross + \frac{\Deltat^2}{2}\omegaCross^2$ and $\boldsymbol{\Psi_k} \sim \bI_{3\times 3}\Deltat +  \frac{\Deltat^2}{2}\omegaCross - \frac{\Deltat^3}{6}\omegaCross^2$. The exponential function in this equation refers to the matrix exponential.

These expressions are now what we need to establish a discrete version of the state equations, which are based on this transition matrix $\StateTransitionMat_k$. 

\subsection{Discrete covariance matrices}
Since we have a discrete system, it is also necessary to also represent the propagation error covariance matrix discretely. The discrete propagation covariance matrix $\noiseCovMat$ sampled between time $t_k$ and $t_{k+1} =t_{k}+\Deltat$ is related to the continuous matrix $\noiseCovMat_c$ through the relationship \citep{Maybeck:1982vh}:
$$
\displaystyle\noiseCovMat = \int^{t_{k+1}}_{t_k} \StateTransitionMat(t_{k+1},\tau)\Gc(\tau)\noiseCovMat_c\Gc^T(\tau)\StateTransitionMat^T(t_{k+1},\tau)d\tau.
$$
The full result of this integration is given in \citep{Trawny:2005va}. To the second order in $\Deltat$, the equations simplify when $\gyroVec\to \boldsymbol{0}$ into:
\begin{eqnarrays}
\noiseCovMat_{11} &=& \sigma_\gyro^2\Deltat\cdot\bI_{3\times 3},\\
\noiseCovMat_{12} &=& -\sigma_\bias^2\frac{\Deltat^2}{2}\cdot\bI_{3\times 3},\\
\noiseCovMat_{22} &=& \sigma_\bias^2\Deltat\cdot\bI_{3\times 3},
\end{eqnarrays}
with 
\begin{equations}
\noiseCovMat = \begin{bmatrix} \noiseCovMat_{11} & \noiseCovMat_{12} \\ \noiseCovMat_{12}^T & \noiseCovMat_{22}\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equations}
\subsection{Discrete Kalman filter setup}
%A truth model is a description of how the true state evolves physically. While the state representation can be given in continuous terms, here we immediately use a discrete approach. We have:
Now that we obtained all discrete representation of our system, we can write the algorithm's steps. The Kalman filter will estimate the current attitude quaternion and gyroscope bias value, while minimizing the covariance of the error $\ErrorState$. Below, we summarize the relevant physical equations that are used to set up this filter. This is useful if one wants to build a physical model of the dynamic system.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Velocity estimate}: $\EstGyroVec_{k} = \gyroVec_k^{\textrm{meas}} - \EstBias_{k}$,
\item \textbf{Attitude propagation}: $\EstAttitude_{k} = \exp\left(\frac{1}{2}\matOmega(\EstGyroVec_{k})\Deltat\right)\EstAttitude_{k-1},$
\item \textbf{Error state evolution}: $\ErrorState_{k}  = \StateTransitionMat_{k}\ErrorState_{k-1} + \Gc_{k}\vectors{n}_{k}$,
\item \textbf{Error covariance to be minimized}: $\stateCovMat_{k} = \cov{\ErrorState_{k}}$,
\item \textbf{Error covariance evolution}: $\stateCovMat_{k}  =   \StateTransitionMat_k \stateCovMat_{k-1}\StateTransitionMat^T_k + \noiseCovMat_k$,
\item \textbf{New attitude measurement}: $\Attitude^{\textrm{meas}}_k$, 
\item \textbf{State error measurement}: $\zMeasurement_k = \measErrMat_k\ErrorState_k + \nMeas_k$. 
\end{enumerate}

Note that in that last step, the error measurement $\zMeasurement_k$ is determined by extracting $\deltaTheta_k^{\textrm{meas}}$ from the difference quaternion $\delta\Attitude_k = \Attitude^{\textrm{meas}}_k \otimes \EstAttitude^{-1}_{k}$ using the small angle approximation. Furthermore, we have $\vectors{n}_k = \begin{bmatrix} \nGyros & \nBias \end{bmatrix}^T$, $\nMeas_k$ is the measurement noise, and in our case $\measErrMat_k = \begin{bmatrix} \bI_{3\times 3} & \bzero_{3\times 3} \end{bmatrix}$.

At each step, we will attempt to produce our best estimate of the state $\EstStateVec$, and keep track of the evolution of the state error $\ErrorState$ and its covariance matrix $\stateCovMat$. There are two distinct phases in the Kalman filter: the prediction, and the update.

In the prediction phase, we use our best estimates from the previous step, along with the velocity measurements and the expected propagation relationships to predict what the estimates should be at the current step. If we don't get a new attitude measurement at that step, then these new estimates are the best we can do.

When we do get a new attitude measurement, then in addition to the prediction phase, we also do an update phase. We compare the best estimate from the prediction phase to our new measurement, and use the difference to compute a correction to our state. This uses the weights of the various noise contributors in the system, as well as additional weights that can be defined by the user. This phase most importantly estimates the bias of the gyroscopes, to allow robust propagation of the state from one step to the next.

In this section, however, we assume that the attitude measured by the star camera $\Attitude^{\textrm{meas}}_k$ corresponds to the attitude at the current step. In reality, when we receive the star camera, it represents an attitude that was taken some number of steps ago. This is due to the slow processing of the star camera images and the catalog search. Our software cannot solve the star camera position in one single loop iteration. We tackle this issue in Section~\ref{subsec:delayed}. 

\subsection{Kalman filter: prediction}

% The Kalman filter propagation equations for the state error can be written:
% \begin{eqnarrays}
% \ErrorState_{k|k-N} & = & \StateTransitionMat_{k}\ErrorState_{k-1|k-N} \\
% \stateCovMat_{k|k-N} & =  & \StateTransitionMat_k \stateCovMat_{k-1|k-N}\StateTransitionMat^T_k + \noiseCovMat_k
% \end{eqnarrays}

The notation $\ErrorState_{k|k-N}$ corresponds to the estimate made at step $k$ knowing the value at step $k-N$, where $k-N$ corresponds to the step at which we received the last absolute attitude measurement. 
% In our implementation, we receive a new gyroscope measurement $\gyroVec_k^{\textrm{meas}}$, and we suppose that we already have an estimate of the error state $\EstErrorState_{k-1|k-1}$ (through the estimate of the attitude $\EstAttitude_{k-1|k-1}$ and the bias $\EstBias_{k-1|k-1}$), and the state covariance matrix $\stateCovMat_{k-1|k-1}$. The propagation steps of the Kalman filter are aimed to form our best estimate of the state at step $k$, knowing the state at step $k-1$:

The algorithmic steps for this phase are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Predict the bias}: $\EstBias_{k|k-N} = \EstBias_{k-1|k-N}$ since there is no new information to allow us to update the bias.
\item \textbf{Estimate the angular velocity}: $\EstGyroVec_{k|k-N} = \gyroVec_k^{\textrm{meas}} - \EstBias_{k|k-N}$.
\item \textbf{Predict the attitude}: $\EstAttitude_{k|k-N} = \exp\left(\frac{1}{2}\matOmega(\EstGyroVec_{k|k-N})\Deltat\right)\EstAttitude_{k-1|k-N}.$
\item \textbf{Compute the state transition matrix}: $\StateTransitionMat_k = \begin{bmatrix} \boldsymbol{\Theta}_k & \boldsymbol{\Psi}_k \\ \bzero_{3\times 3} & \bI_{3\times 3}\end{bmatrix}$ using $\EstGyroVec_{k|k-N}$ in the expressions of $\boldsymbol{\Theta}_k$ and $\boldsymbol{\Psi}_k$.
\item \textbf{Compute the added noise covariance matrix}: $\noiseCovMat_k$. This corresponds to the noise that is added by the new gyro measurement.
\item \textbf{Update the state covariance matrix}: $\stateCovMat_{k|k-N}  =   \StateTransitionMat_k \stateCovMat_{k-1|k-N}\StateTransitionMat^T_k + \noiseCovMat_k$
\end{enumerate}
We have now propagated our system from step $k-1$ to step $k$, and we have three new quantities: the bias $\EstBias_{k|k-N}$, the attitude estimate $\EstAttitude_{k|k-N}$, and the state covariance matrix $\stateCovMat_{k|k-N} $. If we do not get any star camera measurement, then at the next step we will just continue propagating with this procedure.

\subsection{Kalman filter: update}
\label{subsec:EKFUpdate}

The star camera information provides us with a measurement of the attitude $\Attitude^{\textrm{meas}}_{k}$, which is compared to our predicted attitude. We use the difference between our prediction and the measurement to update the bias and the state covariance matrix. Under certain circumstances, the Kalman filter is the optimal estimator: it converges towards the correct solution with the minimum amount of iterations.

For the Kalman filter update procedure, we form a measurement vector $\zMeasurement_{k}$ that corresponds to the difference of an attitude measurement at step $k$ and the predicted attitude at step $k$.

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{6}
\item \textbf{Compute the innovation}: $\zMeasurement_{k} =  \deltaTheta^\textrm{meas}_{k}$ with $\deltaTheta^\textrm{meas}_{k}$ extracted from the difference quaternion $\delta\Attitude_{k} = \Attitude^{\textrm{meas}}_{k} \otimes \EstAttitude^{-1}_{k|k-N}$. 
\item \textbf{Compute the innovation covariance}: $\measErrCovMat_{k} = \measErrMat_{k}\stateCovMat_{k|k-N}\measErrMat^T_{k} + \measCovMat_{k}$.
\item \textbf{Compute the Kalman gain}: $\KalmanGain_{k} = \stateCovMat_{k|k-N}\measErrMat^T_{k}\measErrCovMat^{-1}_{k}$.
\item \textbf{Update error state}: $\ErrorState_{k|k} = \KalmanGain_{k} \zMeasurement_{k} = \begin{bmatrix} \deltaTheta \\ \deltaBias\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 2\DeltaQuatVec \\ \deltaBias\end{bmatrix}$
\item \textbf{Update attitude estimate}: $\EstAttitude_{k|k} =\delta\Attitude\otimes \EstAttitude_{k|k-N}$ with $\delta\Attitude = \begin{bmatrix} \sqrt{1-\DeltaQuatVec^T\DeltaQuatVec} \\ \DeltaQuatVec\end{bmatrix}$ if $\DeltaQuatVec^T\DeltaQuatVec \leqslant 1$, or $\delta\Attitude = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\DeltaQuatVec^T\DeltaQuatVec}}\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \DeltaQuatVec \end{bmatrix}$ otherwise.
\item \textbf{Update the bias}: $\EstBias_{k|k} = \EstBias_{k|k-N} + \deltaBias$.
\item \textbf{Update the angular velocity estimate}: $\EstGyroVec_{k|k} = \gyroVec_k^{\textrm{meas}} - \EstBias_{k|k}$
\item \textbf{Update state covariance matrix with Joseph's form}: $\stateCovMat_{k|k} = (\bI_{6\times 6} - \KalmanGain_{k}\measErrMat_{k})\stateCovMat_{k|k-N}(\bI_{6\times 6} - \KalmanGain_{k}\measErrMat_{k})^T + \KalmanGain_{k}\measCovMat_{k}\KalmanGain_{k}^T.$
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Delayed star camera solution}
\label{subsec:delayed}

In general, the star camera takes much longer than one single loop cycle to produce an attitude estimate. Between the time we trigger the star camera frame and the time we receive the attitude measurement, we need to keep track of the propagation matrices that will allow to express both the attitude and its covariance matrix in the current reference frame, where the measurement can be combined with the a priori estimate from the Kalman filter.

While no new star camera measurement is available, the attitude transition is expressed by $\EstAttitude_{k} = \exp\left(\frac{1}{2}\matOmega(\EstGyroVec_{k})\Deltat\right)\EstAttitude_{k-1},$ and the new covariance is $\stateCovMat'_{k}  =  \StateTransitionMat_k \stateCovMat_{k-1}\StateTransitionMat^T_k + \noiseCovMat_k$, where we assume that $\noiseCovMat_k$ is a constant. We can consider that the gyroscope bias does not change significantly during the time between two star camera measurement (typically on the order of a few seconds). With this we can create a recursive relationship and $\Attitude_{k} = \left[\boldsymbol\Pi_{i=k-N}^k\exp\left(\frac{1}{2}\matOmega(\EstGyroVec_{i})\Deltat\right)\right]\Attitude^{\textrm{meas}}_{k-N}$ where $k-N$ again represents the index at which the star camera image was taken. Similarly, we have: $\stateCovMat_{k} = \A_k\stateCovMat_{k-N}\A_k^T + \B_k$ where $\A_k$ and $\B_k$ are defined recursively as $\A_k = \StateTransitionMat_{k}\A_{k-1}$ with $\A_0 = \bI_{6\times 6}$, and $\B_k = \noiseCovMat_k + \StateTransitionMat_{k}\B_{k-1}\StateTransitionMat_{k}^T$ with $\B_0 = \boldsymbol{0}_{6\times 6}$. $\A_k$ can also be written  $\A_k = \StateTransitionMat_{k}\StateTransitionMat_{k-1}\cdots\StateTransitionMat_{k-N} = \left[\boldsymbol\Pi_{i=k-N}^k\StateTransitionMat_{i}\right]$.

Hence, once we trigger the star camera, we need to start keeping track of the matrices $\A_k$, $\B_k$, and $\C_k = \boldsymbol\Pi_{i=k-N}^k\exp\left(\frac{1}{2}\matOmega(\EstGyroVec_{i})\Deltat\right)$, appropriately reset them when a new star camera trigger has occurred, and propagate them until the estimator receives the star camera value.

\subsection{Enhancing the Kalman filter models}
\label{subsec:enhancedKalman}

The simple gyroscope model that we adopt is incomplete, and can cause some issues that need explanation. In our simplified representation, gyroscope models using only a bias to account for the measurement errors. The bias, which combines linearly with the measured velocity, is adjusted by the Kalman filter to correct the errors and minimize the covariance of the error.

However, this supposes that the gyroscopes are perfectly orthogonal, with unity scale factor, and the transformation between the absolute measurement sensor (the star camera) reference frame and the gyro reference frame is known perfectly. An alignment error in either of these two components will translate to multiplicative errors on the velocities, which will have a large effect when the velocity dramatically changes (for example, after a slew) and will not be accounted for by a simple bias model. Eventually, the bias would adjust to be in agreement with the star camera measurements - but it can take a while, and during this time, the velocity that we think we are moving at is incorrect. To put this in perspective, a 1\% error on the gyroscope velocity in one axis for a \SI{10}{\degree} slew at \ang{;;400}\si{\per\second} corresponds to a position error of 6 arcminutes, a considerable amount given our pointing requirements.

For spacecraft projects, alignment issues and calibrations are allocated a large amount of resources to minimize these issues and come close to the ideal configuration. Our project has not dedicated enough resources to ensure exquisite alignment and calibration between the gyroscopes and the star camera, due to lack of time and resources. We nevertheles propose elements of solution in the next section.

If this error persists during flight, the poor man's solution is as follows. Instead of tracking the Kalman filter during the entire duration of the slew, we discard the star camera measurements during the slew and reset the estimator after the slew is complete. This resets our starting position with the first solution from the star camera. Since we will be off our target, we will slew again to the desired target, which will be much closer. Each time this needs to be repeated, we minimize the effects of the alignment errors.

For our scientific purpose, even a 1\% error in the gyroscope scale factor or angular velocity alignment is not a deal breaker, since their main purpose is to maintain sufficient stability to lock onto a guide star with the fine guiding sensor. The fine guiding sensor is by definition in the correct reference frame, since it observes through the optical train. 

\subsubsection{Estimating angular error between reference frames}

Here, we propose an appropriate approach to estimate the gyroscope misalignment using a different Kalman filter. In this filter, the global misalignment error of the entire reference frame is set as part of the state, and is being estimated at each step. A global misalignment error can be represented by a rotation matrix which, in the small angle approximation, can be written $\boldsymbol{C'} \approx \bI_{3\times 3} + \boldsymbol{C} $, with:
\begin{equations}
\boldsymbol{C} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & c_{xy} & c_{xz} \\   -c_{xy} & 0 &c_{yz} \\  -c_{xz} & -c_{yz} & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\end{equations}
We now have $\gyroVec^\textrm{true} = (\bI_{3\times 3} - \textbf{C})\gyroVec^\textrm{meas}$, so the gyro error introduced by the misalignment is $\Delta\gyroVec=-\textbf{C}^T\gyroVec^\textrm{meas}$. The new state components are $\textbf{c} = \begin{bmatrix} c_{xy}& c_{xz} & c_{yz}\end{bmatrix} ^T$, and we can rearrange the matrix terms to express $\boldsymbol{\Omega}_c$ as a function of the components of $\gyroVec^\textrm{meas}$ and write: $\Delta\gyroVec =\boldsymbol{\Omega}_c \textbf{c}$. Similarly to the error-representation equations in the Kalman filter model expressed in the previous sections, we then obtain the new upper right block of the transition matrix:
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\Psi_k} = -\boldsymbol{\Omega}_c\Delta t.
\end{equation}

This is useful because the three additional state elements can replace the gyroscope bias for initial calibration and determination. When on the ground, it is then possible, with minimum software changes, to estimate the three components of a rotation matrix instead of the three components of a bias vector. 

\subsubsection{Estimating the orthogonalization error and scale factor error}

The full orthogonalization matrix for the three gyroscopes is a non-orthogonal matrix $\textbf{M}$:
\begin{equations}
\boldsymbol{M} = \begin{bmatrix} k_x & m_{xy} & m_{xz} \\   m_{yx} & k_y &m_{yz} \\  m_{zx} & m_{zy} & k_z \end{bmatrix},
\end{equations}
where $\textbf{k} = \begin{bmatrix}k_{x} &k_{y} &k_{z}\end{bmatrix}^T$ is the scale factor of the gyroscopes, and the cross terms correspond to the misalignments between the different axes. This can also be rearranged and rewritten in terms of the three scale factor unknowns and the 6 cross terms unknowns $\textbf{m} = \begin{bmatrix}m_{xy} &m_{xz} &m_{yx} &m_{yz} &m_{zx} &m_{zy}\end{bmatrix}^T$:
\begin{equations}
\Delta\gyroVec_k = \boldsymbol{\Omega}_k\textbf{k},
\Delta\gyroVec_m = \boldsymbol{\Omega}_m\textbf{m},
\end{equations}
for a total error in velocity $\Delta\gyroVec = \Delta\gyroVec_k + \Delta\gyroVec_m + \Delta\gyroVec_\bias$ if we also include the bias that we discussed in our standard estimator. We have here:
\begin{equations}
\boldsymbol{\Omega}_k = \begin{bmatrix} \omega_x & 0 & 0 \\   0 &  \omega_y  &0 \\  0 & 0 & \omega_z \end{bmatrix}
\end{equations}
and
\begin{equations}
\boldsymbol{\Omega}_m = \begin{bmatrix} \omega_y & \omega_z & 0 & 0  & 0 & 0 \\    0 & 0 & \omega_x &\omega_z  & 0 & 0  \\  \ 0 & 0 & 0  & 0 & \omega_x &\omega_y  \end{bmatrix}.
\end{equations}
This is now a 15-state Kalman filter, with the error state:
$\ErrorState = \begin{bmatrix}\deltaTheta &\Delta\textbf{k}  &\Delta\textbf{m} &\Delta\bias\end{bmatrix}^T$. The top right block of the transition matrix can be written:
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\Psi_k} = -\Delta t\begin{bmatrix}\boldsymbol{\Omega}_k&\boldsymbol{\Omega}_m & \bI_{3\times 3}\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}

This is handy for data analysis on the ground, but not appropriate for flight since increasing the state vector size quickly increases the computational cost of the filter. While running this Kalman filter implementation in the Real Time OS on \boop, we measured average run times of $\sim\SI{0.4}{\second}$, largely caused by the $15\times 15$ matrix inversion process that happens during the update phase of the filter.

%It is nonetheless possible to use a more refined model of the gyroscope velocity measurement. There are three effects that can be included in a linear model: the scale factor error, the orthogonalization error, and the alignment error. The orthogonalization error comes from the fact that the individual gyroscopes do not form an orthogonal basis. The alignment error is an error of the orthogonal gyro reference frame from its expected position. We can write:
%
%\begin{equations}
%\gyroVec^\textrm{meas} = \boldsymbol{C'}\boldsymbol{M'}\gyroVec^\textrm{true},
%\end{equations}
%where $\boldsymbol{M'}$ is is the orthogonalization matrix and $\boldsymbol{C'}$ is the rotation matrix in the small approximation:
%\begin{equations}
%\boldsymbol{M} = \begin{bmatrix} M_x & m_{xy} & m_{xz} \\   m_{yx} & M_y &m_{yz} \\  m_{zx} & m_{zy} & M_z \end{bmatrix}, \boldsymbol{C'} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & c_{xy} & c_{xz} \\   -c_{xy} & 1 &c_{yz} \\  -c_{xz} & -c_{yz} & 1 \end{bmatrix}.
%\end{equations}
%
%In order to convert this to a linear model, we use the small angle approximation $\boldsymbol{C'} = bI_{3\times 3} + \boldsymbol{C} $ and develop the expression ignoring second order terms:

\subsection{Conclusions on sensor fusion}

We have defined, designed, implemented and tested a complete sensor fusion algorithm based on an multiplicative, extended Kalman filter, which has several steps summarized in Fig.~\ref{fig:kalmanFilterSteps}.

This software, implemented entirely in Labview Real Time OS, has been the workhorse of our testing of the control system. Similarly, we have implemented several variations of the software for use on the ground, in order to estimate the residual misalignments between the individual gyroscopes, as well as between the gyroscope frame and the star cameras.

The software merges the information gathered from the gyroscopes and the star cameras, while appropriately correcting for the lag in the star camera measurements, and accounting for user-defined weights. 

While this software is deeply integrated with our hardware and flight software architecture, its critical components are quite independent. We plan on sharing this software with an open-source license after the pointing test results are published. It is quite versatile and allows for many user improvement and modifications.
