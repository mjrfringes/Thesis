\section{Derivation of requirements from the science}
\subsection{	Relevant timescales (flows well because it is relevant to chapter 2)}
\subsection{	Expected perturbations}
\subsubsection{	High-altitude winds and pendulum motions}
Insert here the picture of the pendulum mode showing the error introduced due to mispointing
\subsubsection{	High-frequency embedded perturbations}
Show here a PSD of the noise spectrum recorded by the gyroscopes, when it is lifted and the wheels are on/off, and when it is on the ground with the wheels on
Need the wheels to be synchronized...
\subsection{	Perturbation rejection requirements }
\subsection{	Required control performance}
\subsection{	Required knowledge performance}
