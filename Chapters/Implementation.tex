\section{Key pre-flight procedures}
\subsection{Inertia measurement}
While CAD models allowed to us to estimate the moment of inertia of the payload, this is only an approximation. For testing and for launch, the payload will be different than the model we have: we will either miss some components because they are not yet installed, or have additional components such as the ballasts, the crush pads, or the weights that are used to balance the payload.
